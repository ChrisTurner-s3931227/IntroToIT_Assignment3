  <h3>Chris Turner - s3931227</h3>

  <p>Chris is 21 years old and has started to study for the Bachelor of IT this year. He comes from an English background with their dad being born in the United Kingdom.
    His hobbies include the usual nerd type stuff such as video games, anime and has enjoyed learning 3D modelling + programming for the past few years on the side.
    They have had a long-term interest in IT since they were 13 years old with their main IT interests being in object orientated programming, computer hardware and reverse engineering of retro software.
    Chris went to study a Certificate IV in Information Technology in 2020, and then a Diploma of Software Development in 2021 – both at a TAFE, which is the only ‘formal’ IT experience they have.

    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    The key take aways from this test to keep in mind while working in a group is the introverted aspect.
    Working in a group requires all team members to be active and actively communication with each other,
    solving problems and resolve any conflict that may arise which is the opposite of what an introvert would ‘enjoy’ so to say.
    It’s possible that the agreeableness is a major trait as they wish to avoid that sort of confrontation, which at the same time may make it hard to provide constructive criticism.
    It will be important to get out of this comfort zone of being introverted in order to work efficiently as a group,
    but other team members should also keep in mind this is a foreign/uncomfortable experience for the person as to not too harshly judge them.
    Being overly self-critical may delay how soon the work gets completed also, which other team members will rely on.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>Connor O’Loughlin – s3949499</h3>

  <p>
    Connor has recently moved to Melbourne in the last few months in order to study at RMIT for the Bachelor of Information Technology.
    He is an avid fan of video games enjoys watching the occasional TV series.
    Connors interest in IT started quite recently when he took Applied Computing: Software Development in VCE last year where he enjoyed the programming aspect the most.
    The bulk of his current IT knowledge stems from classes he has took in the past where he learnt about different design concepts and a surface level know how of Python.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9EDh5rc.png" alt="bigfive-connor">
    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    Two of the major characteristics of this team member to keep in mind is the ambitiousness and at the same time how ‘unfocused’ they may be.
    As this will all be leading to implementing a project idea, it is vital to not come up with an idea that will be overly ambitious for our skill set,
    and also not get ambitious with the features in each stage of development.
    Being unfocused also means that they may forget or lack the motivation to keep up a consistent work ethic in a heavily team-based effort
    (meaning they may need an occasional reminder/push to keep at it). This would also not be a very good pairing with being overly ambitious.
    This member also scored highly on intellect/imagination which is the exact sort of trait you need in a field of problem solving, which will be a valuable asset.

  <h3>Mason Graham – s3953383</h3>
  <p>
    Mason has lived his life in Victoria, coming from a Scottish and Maltese background with their parents moving to Australia in the 1950s as migrants.
    He completed his VCE in 2021 and was able to secure a place at RMIT to study the Bachelor of Information Technology.
    Mason has always had a love for footy and cricket since he was young but has a history of being diagnosed with scoliosis in year 7 and hearing struggles.
    Despite being an outdoors person, he still has had an interest in IT since he was around 14 with a stark interest in the military and governmental applications of computing.
    His prior IT interest comes form studying related fields in VCE, carefully reading the textbooks.

    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    From looking at the test results, it can be concluded that they are a much more independent/individual learner, introverted and empathetic to others around them.
    Having strong independence and individuality means that they will not have to rely heavily on other team members to complete their tasks,
    but at the same time they could be too independent and thus may not communicate clearly enough with their team often enough,
    leaving other members confused or unsure how the overall project is coming along or what they are doing.
    Empathy will be a good characteristic to have as it may mean that they will be easy going if not helpful to members who are struggling,
    helping the team to get along and keep up the pace of the work.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h3>Nate Winter – s3948929</h3>

  <p>
    Nate is a born and raised Australian in a family of 5, with an ancestral history stemming from multiple western European cultures.
    With a diverse family history, Nate enjoys learning different languages, studying Japanese throughout all of high school and is keen to start learning German.
    He has been a fan of videos games since he was only 5 years old, playing them to this very day. His interest in IT started at the same time as his interest in video games,
    finding that he enjoyed tinkering with computers, modifying video games and helping his family with any technical issues that they may have.
    In high school Nate enjoyed taking software development subjects which he could foresee doing as a career,
    and wishes to learn about popular languages like C#, C++ and Swift. He also has a side interest in security and networking, spending time outside of school learning about these things.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XytbEYG.png" alt="bigfive-mason">
    <br>


    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    From these results, Nate can be interpreted as a shy and introverted person, but still very empathetic, understanding and a team player. \
    Like with Mason, this member will be able to understand other members and if they’re struggling, not become frustrated if they are falling behind if not offer to help.
    It also shows that they can be quite self-critical and pessimistic which is both good and bad.
    The good is that it means that their work will that of a high standard and will be able to come up with constructive criticism,
    but may become overwhelmed with critical thoughts and wish to give up which will be important for other team members to keep in mind.
    They may also need help with poor self discipline, needing that occasional push himself.

  <h3>Sean Shlemoon – s3660535</h3>

  <p>
    Sean was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan over in the United States with an Assyrian background which is an ethnic/cultural group originating from the Syria/Iraq/Turkey area of the Middle East.
    Sean enjoys programming (testing out different languages and their best applications), learning about the history of different cultures,
    playing video games and creating a potential business plan for the future. Sean’s interest in IT has been there since he was 10 years old,
    being deemed the family “technician” always learning new IT concepts and experimenting (which serves as his prior IT experience).
    His main IT interests revolve around software engineering and cybersecurity due to how much of the current world relies on these areas of specialty.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VZpQ27Y.pngg" alt="bigfive-sean">
    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    The most notable result from these tests is the conscientiousness aspect. This means that someone is very diligent, thorough and generally a hard worker.
    There is a very good chance this means that other team members will always be able to rely on them to do a great job.
    Openness was another important aspect which may very much mean that they’ll always be open to what they are thinking about the task at hand
    which is a vital thing to have as working in a team means being open to discussion and criticism. These characteristics would make a great candidate for a team leader,
    and someone you will be able to rely on.

  <h3>Kowsar Rahman - s3825159</h3>

  <p>
    Kowsar is a passionate student originally from Bangladesh who began studying at RMIT in 2019, and is now in his third year of the Bachelor of Computer Science.
    He discovered his love for IT when he was in year 8, taking a keen interest in web development using languages such as PHP hoping to publish a finished app.
    This has evolved to additionally knowing Java, JavaScript and Python.

  </table>

  </p>
  <p>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    Kowsar is the most unique out of this team, getting the Architect (INTJ). This implies that he has a more intuitive, thinking/analytical and critical ways of thinking.
    These things could be a massive benefit to the team such as the analytical and intuition aspects, especially when it comes to the implementing the project.
    Creating an IT related project (such as an app) requires an extended amount of careful planning, thinking of how the implementation plan should be structured,
    how they would go about doing it and developing it. These sorts of skills require a very logical way of thinking,
    with the critical and pessimistic aspects helping to keeps things to a feasible/realistic scale, discovering any flaws in the plan to as what wouldn’t really work out,
    and are generally great ways of thinking when it comes to creating an IT related idea (such as with programming).
    Kowsar would be a valuable asset when it comes to development.

  <h2>
    Team Profile - Ideal Jobs
  </h2>


  <h3>Chris Turner – Penetration Tester </h3>
  <p>
    The ideal job for Chris is that of a “penetration tester” or otherwise known as an “ethical hacker”.
    The role of a penetration hacker tester is to perform authorised security tests on computer systems/networks
    in order to find any security vulnerabilities which may lead to sensitive data getting leaked or finances best stolen.
    Chris plans on obtaining these skills by continuing to pick relevant courses in higher education, picking up relevant internships when possible,
    self-study via a combination of textbooks and online courses and attempting to complete previous exams/papers sourced from not only RMIT but other universities
    out there when they feel confident enough.
  </p>


  <h3>Connor O’Loughlin - Systems Analyst/Software Developer</h3>

  <p>
    Connors ideal job is to be a systems analyst. The purpose of a systems analyst is to analyse computers and systems in use of the client,
    determining the best software and hardware to use for the client's needs. This also includes maintenance so everything is up to date,
    working as expected and looking for anything that could be improved upon to improve efficiency of the client. Many system analysts are also programmers,
    creating any specialised piece of software that they may need.
    His plan for achieving a role like this by learning intermediate python skills, improving design and presentation skills,
    and user orientated development via university courses. For the mathematics aspects (statistical modelling)
    he may need to study outside of university for this using whatever resources that can be found on the internet.
    The remainder of the needed skills planned to be picked up naturally as he progresses through university.
  </p>

  <h3>Kowsar Rahman – Full Stack Developer </h3>

  <p>
    Kowsar wishes to become a full stack developer in the future. A full stack dev is simply someone who develops both the back-end side of software
    (the technical side of things the end user doesn’t see, such as the code or the database) and the front end (most often the stuff the user does see, like the UI/UX with HTML and CSS).
    It’s what a lot of people think of when they hear “programmer”.
    Kowsar is already in his final year of university completing many courses and projects both part of university and on the side for fun,
    meaning he already has many of the skills needed for such a role. His skills could be further refined by further developing more complex projects on the side,
    attending “code-a-thon" type events and taking on advanced programming and interview challenges (with websites such as Coderbyte or Leetcode).

  </p>

  <h3>Mason Graham – Systems Administrator/Cyber Security Specialist </h3>

  <p>

    Mason aims to become a systems administrator, hoping to go on to specialise in cyber security related fields.
    A systems admin is the main person responsible for upkeeping and configuring the computer systems and their network.
    This also includes protecting the data stored on the network (hence the cyber security desire).
    Masons wants to get the skills needed by continuing to attend university and picking relevant courses
    over the course of 3 years but also gain experience by taking internships and gaining further understanding (unspecified).
  </p>

  <h3>Nate Winter – Senior Game Development Tools Developer </h3>

  <p>
    Due to Nates passion for video games, he would seek out to become a software developer in the video game industry,
    developing third party tools that game developers over the world use. An example of these tools could be an audio editing piece of software that
    lets audio engineers and programmers build and implement complex audio systems in a variety of game engines (eg: FMOD).
    He has stated that he would prefer to complete a Bachelor of Computer Science as the required skills needed would naturally come through that.
    He would also pick relevant courses and electives in object orientated programming, looking for an opportunity to learn the Unity engine via online documentation and videos,
    and to look for a more entry level game development job upon graduating.
  </p>

  <h3>Sean Shlemoon – Software Engineer</h3>

  <p>
    Seans ideal job would be something akin to a software engineer at a silicon valley type company (such as Google).
    This is developing their websites or applications that are used by millions of people around the world on a daily basis,
    with Google also utilizing and coming up with some of the most innovative technology out there.
    Sean has stated that he plans to gain the skills needed by continuing to study at university,
    self-studying a wide variety of programming languages via online courses or “bootcamps” (at the moment, Java and JavaScript) and hours of hard work.
  </p>


  <h2>Analysis of Ideal Jobs</h2>

  <p>
    After reading over and analysing the all the team members, the following can be concluded:<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>All the team members ideal jobs involve something to do with software development or programming to some degree.
      The extent of this programming ability differs though. For example: a penetration tester would require intermediate knowledge of scripting languages and
      some traditional languages like Python and mySQL while a software engineer would need years of programming experience of advanced languages such as C++, Java or Python.
      Granted these requirements would depend heavily on the specific job listing</li>

    <br>
    <li>Some or many of these roles would require web development experience also in languages like Java, JavaScript and PHP (and scripting languages like HTML, CSS and mySQL)
      such as for a full stack developer or for someone specializing in a more cyber security orientated role.</li>

    <br>
    <li>Three of these ideal jobs are more software development orientated jobs (Full stack, game developer, software engineer),
      as in these focus much more on creating software for end users to use, while the remaining (penetration tester, systems analyst, systems admin) are more orientated towards creating,
      maintaining and securing systems and networks in use by workplaces and such. </li>

    <br>
    <li>The systems analyst/systems admin/penetration tester are roles that would work well together as they all have some sort of focus on software and network security, making them similar to each other.
      While full-stack/game developer/software engineer would go well together since they all focus on making end software for regular users to use.</li>

    <br>
    <li>As part of our plans to gain the skills required, they all include using university studies as the primary way of obtaining them,
      with the second most common plan to self-study using online resources such as short courses, videos and text-books.
      Taking possible internships was also mentioned a few times</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>

    This knowledge could be applied to how we go on about future tasks, mainly the project itself.
    If we are to develop an app or website, then that task would for the most part be handed off to the members who are interested in heavily software development orientated jobs.
    Meanwhile the more logistical and any security or network side of things could be handed off to the remainder. It is best to hand off tasks that relate to people’s ideal jobs and interests,
    as that would mean they would enjoy doing it thus having more motivation to get a high standard of work done and sooner.
    Overall the group does have a lot in common when it comes to ideal jobs with similar interests and careers.
    They should be able to comfortably understand most potential concepts and terminology that are likely to be brought up.
    The group should be able to get along and work together well.

  <p>
    When it comes to seeing how well the GitHub commit history represents group contributions, this is not a good way of gauging that.
    The reason for this being that all the group work was done in a .docx file in Microsoft Teams,
    where after finishing everything the person who was tasked with the tools section would copy and paste it into the website –
    handling the website by themselves. It was done like this as we believed this would have been the simplest and most streamlined way of doing the website and overall assignment. <br><br>

    Industry Data
  </h2>

  <p>
    Our Team Members Christpher Turner and Mason Graham desires Penetration Tester and Cyber Security Analyst as their preferred job titles. Christopher wants to work as a Penetration Tester which is primarily testing a system’s vulnerability against attacks and best ways to prevent them from hacking. On the other hand, Mason seems himself as the person who will be responsible for taking care of the networking system and helping to protect the data stored on the network. Both Mason and Christopher want to work on the Cyber Security industry. According to Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) based on Data from March 2018, Active Selections of Professions like Systems Administrator, Network Engineer were 681 and 666, respectively. This is an increasing trend as data back in February 2018 showed 655 and 645 respectively for these two professions based on Active Selections of Last 365 days for both Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, the Cyber Security Industry looks promising ahead as 8 in 10 Australians access the internet daily and use social media accounts. Cybercrime is expected to cost around 1 billion dollars to Australian businesses. Australia already has a reputation as a secure, stable country with a robust regulatory framework and legal protections. There are some interesting data that was captured about the cyber security scenario in Australia. Two-thirds of Australians do not read online privacy policies and almost half do not adjust their privacy settings on social media platforms. Many businesses do not realise they could be an attractive target for cybercrime and underestimate the potential harm it could cause. For many small businesses, the cost of purchasing and maintain digital systems can be an issue. Government of Australia has invested more than $230 million in the Cyber Security Industry. Both Mason and Christopher require appropriate knowledge of how the Network works i.e., different protocols and must remain updated regarding latest attack threats and ways to mitigate them. If there is any programming language that they must be aware of is Python. To enter the industry for both, it is better to hold some certifications in Networking or Ethical Hacking. Aside from using Windows, Mason and Christopher are required to be proficient in using Linux for penetration testing. Soft Skills that are required just like any other job are Communication, Teamwork and Troubleshooting for these two job titles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moving on team members like Nate, Connor, Sean, and Kowsar are interested about the software development industry. All 4 of them wants to become a software engineer. Starting with Kowsar. As he wants to become a full stack developer, he needs to have skills in JavaScript, Java, SQL, respectively. Data from Burning Glass based on March 2018, SQL, JavaScript, and Java ranks the top 3 skills based on active selections. On the other hand, Nate is interested to build tools for Game developers. Data of Burning Glass based on March 2018, Graphics Designing has an active selection of 2068 and Microsoft C# has an active selection of 1643. The reason that Microsoft C# has been mentioned because at some point of time, Nate must use Unity Game Development Engine to make elements for games and using Unity requires one an expertise on using C# when it comes to the coding part. In that case data based on February 2018, .NET developer has an active selection of 743 from the Burning Glass Data when it comes to Top IT Job Titles. Connor wants to be a System Analyst or a Software Developer. Titles like Service Desk Analyst, Systems Engineer and Systems Administrator are highly ranked in Burning Glass reports every year. Sean out of all team members has the most ambitious ventures as he sees himself working for a big tech like Google. Sean himself has stated that he would develop skills in JavaScript and Java both which we have seen has great demand when we examined the case of Kowsar. General skills remain the same as we have seen the case of Christopher and Mason.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the team is divided on two industries: Software Development and Cyber Security. The IT-specific skills that is present in our team members skill set are SQL, JavaScript, Java, Graphic Design, Technical Support, Linux, and they are all ranked in terms of Active Selections based on Burning Glass Data. All of them are highly demanded by Employers and having skill set on multiple of them makes one competitive in the market. Unfortunately, Project Management, SAP and Git being some highly demanded Specialised skills were absent from our skill set. This is because our desired industries have little interaction with the above-mentioned technologies except Git. Git is essential to know when building software in teams. In case of general skills that are in demand but were missed out from our skill set were Mentoring, Quality Assurance and Control and Organisation Skills. Mentoring skill is needed at least for Nate who is due to be working in Senior positions where part of his responsibilities should involve mentoring fellow junior developers. After looking at the Burning Glass Data, opinion about Software Engineer has surely changed. The term Software Engineer is itself a vague title. For example, titles like Front End Developer, .NET Developer, Java Developer, Full Stack Developer has the same responsibilities as Software Engineer. It might be better to focus on a specific skill set or a programming language like Java, Python or JavaScript.

      Nate: Hi Jurgen, thanks for finding the time for an interview. How about we start by you introducing yourself
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: My name is Jurgen Hein, I am from Germany and came to Australia for work reasons.
      <br><br>
      Nate: How many years of experience do you have in IT?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: I have worked in IT for about 3 and half years in Germany and about 3 years ago I came to Australia to work.
      <br><br>
      Nate: Where do you work currently?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: I work at CC-Solutions (Corporate Computer Solutions) in Clayton as the Director and Secretary.
      <br><br>
      Nate: What kind of work do you and your workplace do?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: Well my workplace is an IT management service provider and we usually work with small businesses and help set up and manage their servers, data and so on.
      <br><br>
      Nate: So owners of small businesses contact you and ask for you to set up servers and such?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: Yes. We sort of act like their IT support like what schools and universities would have except we are obviously separate from their company. So we also would be the ones helping the company when their devices aren’t working, something gets hacked or whatever. And as I said we also setup and manage their servers and backups. So for example we would go into their shop and set up their server. Then we would tell them what they need to buy such as storage devices for backups and such. Then we would make a backup plan for them and then we would manage, complete remote backups and also act as general support through Teamsviewer and we would also communicate with our client as to what they need to do as well. Just as an example we would do a daily remote backup and they would use an external hard drive as a weekly backup.
      <br><br>
      Nate: So have you always worked in a more IT support position?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: Yes that’s what I mostly did in Germany as well
      <br><br>
      Nate: What is some advice you would give to someone looking to work in the same field as you?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: Well I generally don’t think that the entry level for what I do is too hard, so if I was hiring I would look for people who are young, have had long term interest in IT and obviously a degree would help as well. But honestly I think it’s hard to give advice because many people will have many different jobs in IT and IT is also a very big topic that can be things like support but could also include full on software developers so specifically it’s hard to say. Although I would say it is important to find out your strengths and weaknesses and also to know if you prefer the more creative side of IT like software developers or the more structured side like what I do.
      <br><br>
      Nate: What is something you very much enjoy about your job?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: Well I enjoy that my work has some spontaneous things but enough structure for it to be easy to have day to day goals. Although I do think I almost have 2 jobs because I do work with clients and such, I also have my responsibilities as the director so it can be stressful but overall it’s enjoyable.
      <br><br>
      Nate: What is something that is challenging for you?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: I would say dealing with employees who are underperforming. I would say I’m more introverted and don’t like having confrontation so having to tell people off can be annoying but everybody has their role so if I need to tell people off as my role then I just have to.
      <br><br>
      Nate: What interactions do you have with others in your job?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: Well like I said I have to deal with employees and such but if you mean with customers, sometimes it can be frustrating dealing with people who don’t understand how technology works. Like we get many people wanting us to recover data that was lost because they don’t back it up and it is frustrating when they can’t understand that we can’t just magically find their stuff. But usually if we give the client just the general idea of what's happening and leave out the very specific details, mostly they get what we are saying and what we can and cannot do.
      <br><br>
      Nate: How much time do you spend working and how much free time do you usually have in a week?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: Well the time I spend is usually inconsistent so one week I’ll have a lot to do and others I won’t. But most people who work with me spend maybe a few hours outside working hours mainly just to keep clients coming back to us and so that those clients will want to see those specific employees. So for us it’s usually consistent hour time and free time. For me I do spend some weird hours working at home because of my position in the business.
      <br><br>
      Nate: Is there anything about your job that you find specifically challenging or annoying that you wish you could change?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: No, not really. For me, my job is consistent enough for me to be happy and secure in my position. I make enough money and I enjoy my work so there isn’t much I would want to change. But to give a general answer I do know that some people prefer a more creative focussed job and others prefer things to be laid out for them. So like I said before software developers would need to be creative with what they make and how they develop it to be successful. Whereas someone like me has a more direct sense of what we do at work, we have protocols and procedures we go through with every client and not much changes between them and what we do.
      <br><br>
      Nate: Is there anything else you would like to add that I might not have mentioned before we wrap up?
      <br><br>
      Jurgen: No I can’t think of anything to add on.
      <br><br>
      Nate: Ok, thank you Jurgen for your time and for your answers. Your help is much appreciated. </p>
      <br><br>

    <h3>Interview Analysis</h3>

    <p>
      From my interview with Jurgen Hein, I was able to gather some in depth information about general IT work and specifically how working as an external IT support company would be.
      From what Jurgen told me, we can gather that he and his employees usually work either from home or from their offices at their workplace and only go to their clients when they
      are specifically required to be in person. I can also gather that employees are given their clients to work with so maintaining a
      good relationship with their clients is crucial for good communication and also so they can continue receiving work from those clients.
      Jurgen told me that they use the application Teamsviewer to remotely access their clients' servers and computers and he mentioned that they perform
      remote backups this way and are able to deal with problems on demand via Teamsviewer. I can assume that this helps avoid communication issues when
      instead they can just view the computer themselves and fix the issue without stressing out or worrying the client. It would be especially helpful for those clients
      who aren’t as experienced with technology. Jurgen didn’t go into much detail in regards to his work done as the director but he briefly explained that
      he manages the company and checks up on employees to make sure that everyone is up to standard and following procedures. He also explained
       how he has to be the one to confront employees falling behind and helps them get back on track. In regards to people interactions,
       he explained the process of clients hiring them and how the process works.<br><br>
       He explained that they talk to clients about their business position and give advice and information in regards to servers they need and how they would work,
       how they will backup and who will take care of what part, and that they will also act as IT support for when things go wrong.
       From this I can see that most communication happens early on in the process and then once things are in place they only communicate if things need to change, things go wrong, or for checkup reasons (reminding clients to do their backup, etc). From what he told me I can also gather that they would connect to their client's computer when things go wrong and fix it themselves rather than trying to direct the client with what they need to do to fix it. Jurgen explained that besides his responsibilities as the director, their working hours are quite consistent since they are only required to respond during their work times.
       However, he explained that the client and employee relationship is very important and it is what keeps the client coming back for help and
       it also reflects positively on the employee. So he told me that employees will sometimes work outside of working hours to help with issues
       that may have arisen outside working hours or perhaps to explain what needs to be done and help clarify what is happening.
       He put emphasis on the employee-client relationship which implied to me that despite rarely seeing the clients in person,
       maintaining good communication and understanding with clients is very important to be successful.
       When I asked Jurgen about things he enjoys and things he finds challenging he told me that he likes that his
       job had enough day to day structure to feel like he has very specific work time and home time but he does also like the
        spontaneous nature of having to respond when problems arise and also with maintaining relations. <br><br>
        He did explain that in terms of things that are challenging, he said that he finds dealing with other employees more challenging than dealing with clients.
         He told me that checking up on employees or having to tell them off can be hard and sometimes frustrating but he does also like being the
         director so he said he deals with the negatives and positives that come with it.
         He did also say that in general what can be hard is knowing if you like more creative inclined jobs or jobs with more direction.
         He said that he personally likes more structured jobs but said that finding out which you prefer is quite important.
         Overall, we can learn from the information that we got from Jurgen, we now have a much better understanding of what he does for work and how work affects his life,
         we know how important it is for him to have clear communication with clients and lastly,
         he made us more aware of the fact that IT can be more creative or more structured which I think will help us with deciding what field in IT we wish to pursue.

  <h2>
    IT Technologies
  </h2>

  <p>
    The information technology world is constantly changing and evolving with new technological innovations to make our lives more advanced and convenient than ever.
    Because of this it is important for anyone who works in an IT related field to keep up to date and be familiar with these emerging technologies.
    The following are four emerging technologies that have the potential to radically change our lives:
  </p>

  <h3>Technology 1: Clouds, Services and Servers </h3>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>

  <p>
    Cloud technology (or cloud computing) is the technology where various services are hosted and provided by a third party on their hardware/computers/servers in a data center somewhere in the world.
    In other words, you are renting infrastructure, or in other words “infrastructure as a service”.
    The services that can be provided by cloud computing include things such as file hosting, server hosting, virtual machines (operating systems), and networking.
    Some of the most notable cloud services include Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.
    This technology has been around for several years now but has progressively become more relied upon and utilized by average day-to-day people,
    to large companies and everyone in-between as the hardware and pricing have improved. (Clapp 2022, p.29)<br><br>

  </p>

  <p>
    Some of the more specific uses of cloud servers include:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>File storing/backups: one of the most popular uses of the cloud is to store and backup any important files in a safe place.
      This means that if you lose your physical medium that these files are stored on, you will be able to redownload them from the cloud service you chose.
      It also gives people the ability to access their data from anywhere in the world as they have access to the internet,
      meaning they will not have to carry around an external hard drive for example. Many people use this for things like family pictures, school material, important documents
      for work or even just their email service. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Virtual machines/computing: a popular use for the cloud in workplace settings is for virtual machines, utilizing more powerful computers.
      The purpose of this ranges from streamlining and cost efficiency of setting up the computers in the workplace (e.g.: all computers are being streamed from a cloud service,
      thus not needing a physical full computer) to performing intensive tasks such as analyzing/processing big data or cryptography.</li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Test environments: extending from virtual machines, cloud provided computers can be used to test a piece of software in a real-world environment without needing to pay for a
      whole new computer with the specific hardware needed. This would cut down development/testing costs enormously.
      The provider would also update the software for you, so there would be no need to remember to update insecure software.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Business agility: Office environments can still purchase and setup physical hardware (including networking and general IT hardware) themselves which is not only costly but takes time to do.
      With cloud computing delivering everything via servers, office/workplace environments can have their systems up and running in a matter of a few hours.
      There would be no need to get specialists into the workplace to set everything up, which can take an exceptionally long time. </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <br>
    (Vennam, 2020)
  </p>

  <br><br>
  <p>
    As hardware becomes more powerful and the need for large amounts of data storage of physical hardware increases, so will the use of cloud computing services.
    In the future the power of the hardware and storage limits will become more abundant, making lower tier plans even cheaper and thus more appealing for your common person to use.
    By extension, this means the security of cloud services will most likely be improved even further as time goes on as
    having something on a network automatically creates a security target for malicious people.
    Software will also become more modular, meaning pieces or aspects of software will be provided by cloud,
    as this means the end user hardware will not need to be anywhere near as powerful to run the software in mind.
    This could also extend to the improvement to video game steaming services such as Google Stadia or PlayStation Now as now they have limitations with connectivity and accessibility.
    The improvement in cloud services can lead to the improvement of other technologies such as the internet of things (IoT),
    artificial intelligence and analytics/big data as these technologies can already heavily rely on cloud computing due to cost efficiency.
    Although the downside of all of this is increased centralization of data – the reliance of third parties to securely store your data and not be vulnerable to a security breach,
    not use or view your data without consent or have a well-designed data centre so your data will be backed up in case the providers hardware fails (which it will eventually).

  </p>

  <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>

  <p>
    As similarly discussed in the prior section, the impact of the improvement of cloud technologies means that much more of the world will become drawn towards these cloud services,
    thus relying on them much more. There could be a future where many day-to-day people do not necessarily have a
    regular desktop computer or laptop with the standard hardware you would expect as we do today, but merely a device that is capable of streaming
    a large amount of data to your device from a third-party server. Such a system could easily be embedded to the point where it
    could fit into an average sized computer monitor at a fraction of the cost of the computer they would have otherwise purchased.
    It would also make upgrading your hardware a mostly redundant concept.
    Something like this could heavily impact people who work in consumer level device repair and selling of hardware,
    as this industry would heavily shift towards serving the third-party providers, as the average person would only need the streaming device repaired.
    <br>
    Software development fields would also become a lot streamlined, cheaper and accessible as once again,
    you will not have to rely on purchasing the physical hardware or have the space to store it.
    Intensive software that uses substantial amounts of data or numerous/complex mathematics could be offloaded to the computers of IBM for example
    (such as super or quantum computing, though the price to rent these would end up being expensive, but of course cheaper than if you were to buy the hardware yourself.
    Because of this reduced cost, it would also make computing and the internet much more accessible to people and countries of lower socioeconomic status,
    which would provide numerous benefits such as education, accessing government services, create more efficient and numerous job opportunities or just for entertainment. All of this would lead to improved health and wellbeing for these communities
    and connect the world more than ever.

  </p>


  <h3>How will this effect you?</h3>

  <p>
    Advancements in cloud computing would impact my life in certain ways significantly, for many reasons as described in the prior section “what would be the likely impact”.
    For starters, I would no longer need to worry about maintaining and replacing expensive hardware as parts inevitably die or become obsolete,
    not being powerful enough for my needs anymore. How often I would need to troubleshoot hardware issues would be drastically reduced as that would be all
    handled by people at the provider/data center, meaning less headache and time wasted trying to fix these issues.
    By extension this means storage space would become a negligent concern since cloud storage is already incredibly cheap and will become even cheaper in the future.
    If this becomes the standard way of storing things, then backups would also not be a major concern as by the nature of the storage method, they are automatically backed up (although it would be important to store things on multiple services in
    case your account gets hijacked, shut down or an unrecoverable data loss on the provider’s end for example).
    When it comes to people around me, I believe that it would affect my family positively. For example,
    my mum relies mostly on a phone because it was much cheaper and lower maintenance to use at the cost of a less intuitive UX for websites and apps on a phone.
    Having a computer that is as accessible as a phone would make life tremendously easier, not needing to rely on others for assistance with counter institutive UX when it comes to filling out paperwork or general social media. From experience,
    older generations find getting a computer to be troubling because of the cost and maintenance, so improving this accessibility would help a lot for people not tech savvy. Important files would also be automatically backed up which would lower
    reliance on social media, as many people rely on something like Facebook to archive important photos.
    While all of this sounds very convenient, it comes at the cost of centralization and loss of control.
    We will be placing so many of our files, computing, security, privacy, access and overall trust into the hands of a couple of major cloud providers.
    If we are to go down this path, it will be vital to introduce legislation to reduce security and privacy risk as much as possible.
    We would also be handing over control of our systems to these same companies. At the end of the day, they are the ones who control everything,
    meaning if you use their service in a way they don’t like, they can easily prevent you from doing so.
    While advanced cloud computing would be very convenient for everyone in a range of scenarios, it is still important to ask if it is worth the tradeoffs?

  </p>

  <h3>Technology 2: Autonomous Vehicles<h3>

    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <p>Autonomous Vehicles or Self Driving Vehicles is defined by a car which can drive itself from a starting point to a predetermined destination in autopilot mode using
      various in-vehicle technologies and sensors. Autonomous Vehicles use all types of sensors such as GPS, adaptive cruise control, lasers and radar, as well as active steering.
       Autonomous Vehicles were predicted as a realistic future made possible by 2050. However, driven by Elon Musk and his technological car company Tesla brought Autonomous Vehicles forward in 2012 introducing the Tesla Model S. Initiative discovery pushed the technology forward which by the current date 16 major brand car companies such as Ford, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Rolls Royce etc. The technology around Autonomous Vehicles is advancing that it is predicted by 2025 in Victora, Australia or by 2030 where legally Autonomous Vehicles would be allowed to legally drive on the roads with human control.  Autonomous vehicles are allowed in Australia however,
       the road rules have specifically stated they don’t trust the technology enough yet to allow it to be legal.
     </p>

     <p>

       <br><b>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</b><br>
       In the next 3 years it is possible that Autonomous Vehicles will be fully able to drive here in Victoria by 2025.
       As well as car companies such as Fiat, Mercedes Benz, Jaguar will be selling autonomous vehicles.  Car companies such as Tesla will be producing more type of cars as well as trucks.
       The idea behind Autonomous Vehicles is to move away from fossil fuels and engine type cars to battery cars and self-driving cars to lower the risk of accidents and produce a
       better carbon footprint. In 2020, per 100,000 registered vehicles 4.12% of accidents occur and on the Latrobe region
       Gippsland had 28 fatalities on the road with the leading cause of the accidents being speeding (Budget Direct, Car Accident Statistics).
       It is predicted that around 94% of road accident occur due to human error. Autonomous Vehicles would take the human aspect out of driving such as there would be no drink driving,
       no using your phone when driving or just in general distractions as the car would be programmed to simply get you from one place to the other.
</p>
<br>

<p>
      <b>What technological or other developments make this possible</b><br><br>
      Autonomous driving has been divided up into 6 categories of autonomous driving.

        <b>Level 1 – 2 Human in Control</b>
        <br><br>
        Level 0 Human driver performs all driving functions.
        <br><br>
        Level 1 Some level of minor driver assistance e.g. Lane assist or Cruise Control. (Current Technology used in Victoria)
        <br><br>
        This technology includes motion sensor around the car which are looking for the lines on the road which is programmed that if you aren’t indicating the car will beep when you begin to drift into the next lane. Cruise control is the car programmed to maintain the same speed without use of the pedal which allows the driver ability to do less and just focus on keeping their hands on the wheel.
        <br><br>
        Level 2 Partial driver autonomation driver cruise control and lane centering but driver must maintain awareness.
        <br><br>
        Similar to technology above but the car is in more control however, this still requires the driver to aware and watching the roads keeping in control in case of a time they must take in control.
        <br><br>
        <b>Level 3 – 5 ADS in control</b>
        <br><br>
        Level 3 Conditional driver autonomation
        <br><br>
        The driver can have his hands off the wheel or even read a book, but the car will alert the driver when they must take over. This car would use GPS tracking to know where they are going as well as sensors, lasers and alert system to wake the driver.
        <br><br>
        Level 4 High Automation
        <br><br>
        Human does not intervene at all if car is operating correctly.
        <br><br>
        Level 5 Full Automation
        <br><br>
        Full Automation no human impact required.
        <br><br>
        </p>

        <br><br><br>
  <h3>Technology 3: Machine Learning <h3>

    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
      <p>
        Machine learning focuses on various algorithms that are able to automatically improve by using its experiences.
        These algorithms are split into two categories. Supervised Learning, and Unsupervised learning, these categories each have diverse ways of teaching
        AI (Artificial Intelligence) ways to deal with specific tasks. These algorithms include “Classification” which is used for email spam detection,
        customer retention and medical imaging and “Regressions” which is used to automate weather forecasting, marketing forecasting and population growth predictions.
        Both Classification and Regressions are categorized as Supervised machine learning. On the other hand, there is also algorithms like dimensional reduction
        that focuses on various areas such as facial recognition, data visualisation and structure recovery.
        Clustering is also an algorithm used in machine learning being able to be used for recommender systems,
        targeted marketing, and customer segmentation. The primary difference between supervised and unsupervised learning (Juliabba Delua, 2021)
        is that algorithms under supervised learning are given a “training dataset” by which it first learns from before being deployed to actual datasets.
        This method is more accurate than unsupervised with the trade-off being that more human interaction is required.
        In contrast to this unsupervised learning work purely by themselves to discover the meaning behind datasets.
        Although this method requires less human interaction a data analyst is still required to make sure that the output of the algorithm makes sense.
        This process is still less time consuming than supervised learning however could result in less accurate results.
      </p>


      <h3>What is the current state of the art of machine learning </h3>
        <p>
        One of the main innovations of machine learning is deep learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning by which neural networks attempt to simulate the behaviour
        of a human brain via the use of multiple layers of neural networks. (IBM Cloud Education, 2020)
        This is the state of the art of machine learning right now as it allows for additional layers to refine and optimize predictions for a higher level of accuracy.
        Deep learning works by having multi layered, deep neural networks which build upon each other in order to further optimize a prediction or characterisation.
        These algorithms are incredibly complex with ‘multiple layers of interconnected nodes’ where only the input and output layers are the
        ‘visible layers’ whilst the rest of the nodes processing data and classifying it remain hidden. Real world applications of machine learning
        include financial services such as trading stocks, assessing business risks for loan approvals, fraud detection and credit and investment portfolio management.
        </p>

      <h3>What will be able to be done in the next 3 years</h3>

        <p>
          In the next 3 years it is more than likely that machine learning will continue to improve to the point where many jobs and industries will
          be less available to work for due to various processes being automated via machines that have been trained via machine learning. (Predictive Oncology, 2022)
          This can already be seen today as machine learning and artificial intelligence are already being deployed to assist in areas such as cancer research and inventory tracking for businesses.
          This growth is backed up by research performed by Helomics which predicts that the global usage is expected to grow $20 billion by 2025.
           This is because both machine learning and deep learning means that the machines taking over said medical and business industries continuously
           improve and do not need to rest resulting in a possible near 100% uptime and productivity.
        </p>

      <h3>What other technological developments make this possible</h3>
        <p>
          The first neural network was likely one of the most important technologies made to enable the development of machine learning.
          This came into existence with a design made by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 called the proception model. This algorithm was designed to classify visual inputs into two groups.
          Machine learning’s impact is made clear by a prior development called big data (Kathleen Walch, 2021) because of big data being, as the name implies,
         too large and complex to be analysed by traditional data management technologies could not manage the data efficiently or effectively as they did with regular data.
         This is where machine learning came in and could be used to more efficiently analysed large groups of data that was unable to be analysed via traditional means.
        </p>

      <h3>What is it likely to impact?</h3>
        <p>
          As machine learning develops it is likely that the overall impact it has will be widespread. The smaller impacts include more accurate recommender systems which may result in
          people spending more time watching/listing to content they enjoy on services such as Netflix, YouTube and Spotify and less time looking for something to watch.
          Another small improvement that is likely to happen is improved facial recognition. This can affect areas such as easier face ID and surveillance which may
          cause concerns amongst many people who do not like the idea of over tuned surveillance. On the other hand, significantly larger impacts may be made in the fields of industrial automation,
          this will cause many people in various different fields such as mechanics, health,  administrative work and more will be replaced meaning that these people will lose their work and income,
          this could have much larger societal consequences as it may cause governments to implement a type of universal basic income due to numerous people being shifted outside of their work in favour of more effective, efficient and inexpensive machines/artificial intelligence. Decreased job opportunities and automation may still yield negative results with lower standards of living due to people not being accepted into work. This shift to automation may not be as bad as it sounds however with many products becoming cheaper due to increases in productivity causing a surplus of supplies which will surpass the demand therefore becoming cheaper overall for everyone.
          Meanwhile this shift in automation may further divide the distribution of wealth with the people who own the machines continuing
          to get much richer than everyone else who will likely have a lower chance of gaining a high earning income.
        </p>

      <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>

      <p>
        How will it affect me <br>
        Machine Learning and artificial intelligence will end up being a both passive and active impact on my daily life.
        This may take the form of recommender algorithms making it easier to find content I will enjoy on different streaming service platforms like Netflix, twitch, Spotify,
         and YouTube with it being easier to spend time on each platform without long search times. Another more positive aspect of the impact of machine learning can be the
         improvement and better implementation of smart homes and security with facial recognition, as mentioned earlier being able to differentiate between normal family and
         friends visiting vs an unknown visitor and alerting the owners of the house or even contacting law enforcement to assist in stopping the unknown visitor in the event that they are malicious.
          Regarding smart homes and home automation this can be done through things like Alexa and google which can control aspects of our homes via voice control.
          This may include but is not limited to turning on and off lights, locking the door and turning on and off different devices.
           In a more pessimistic view, it may make it harder for me to find work in a few years' time when industrial automation begins to take off as
           I will be seen as more expensive and less effective than a machine that can do my job faster and more constantly than I could.
           The trade off to this could be that various systems of support and cheaper production of goods may eventually offset this lack of income.
           This may affect my family through similar means to me, with home automation and security being the aspects with my family already owning products like a google home.
           However, in regard to work it is likely to affect them more than it does me due to them running a business that is heavily transport based and thus may be more
           susceptible to losing work due to automation as the existence of auto driving motor vehicles is already available with it only needing time before it goes mainstream.

  <h3>Technology 4: Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies<h3>

    <h3>What is the state-of-the-art of this new technology? </h3>

    <p>Suppose you want to have a pizza. You went to Dominos and then order a pizza worth 10 dollars and you decide to pay by your debit card. The cashier hands over you to the EFTPOS machine and then all you need to do is swipe the card. Behind the scenes, your bank will verify whether you have the given money or not in your account. If you have the given money in your account, the bank will deduct the purchase money and then transfer it to the merchant account. The merchant’s account balance will get updated alongside your bank account as well. Notice one thing. There is a central authority who is governing the entire system and has a record of that piece of the transaction. Now comes blockchain technology. Before we do a deep dive, let us make it clear that blockchain and cryptocurrencies are different things. Blockchain is a type of technology while cryptocurrencies run on them. </p>

    <h3>What other technological developments make this possible?</h3>

    <p>According to the website of PWC, A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. Using this technology, participants can confirm transactions without a need for a central clearing authority. Potential applications can include fund transfers, settling trades, voting, and many other issues. The potential application gives us an idea that contrary to the existing notion that blockchain is only related to cryptocurrencies, it has a vast usage scope. Now that we have learned about blockchain, let us explore cryptocurrencies. Traditional currencies like money exist physically and are governed by an authority called the central bank which determines their validity and supply. Cryptocurrency is a virtual currency stored electronically in the blockchain using encryption techniques to control the creation of monetary units. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency followed by other players like Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc. As of now, one bitcoin value equates to USD 38,585.00! Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders. Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. </p>
    <p>In a blockchain environment, someone requests a transaction and that is broadcasted to the P2P network consisting of computers. The network of the computers validates the transaction and the user’s status using known algorithms. Once the transaction is verified, the transaction is combined with other transactions to create a new block of data for the ledger. The new block is added to the existing blocks in such a way that it is permanent and unalterable. This is how blockchain can disrupt various applications for example in healthcare where patient data could be shared with other third parties without the risk of privacy breaches. It is believed that cryptocurrencies are soon going to substitute traditional currencies.  </p>

    <h3>What will be able to be done in the next 3 years? </h3>

    <p>The scenario is vastly changing. Many governments in the past were sanctioning bitcoins given that they cannot control them. However, the situation in El Salvador speaks differently. El Salvador became the first country to approve the use of Bitcoin in transactions. Unfortunately, experts now agree it was a flop decision in El Salvador. For example, government helpline and bitcoin ATMs are too less in number, hence owning bitcoin means going through the hassle. However, it seems like it had nothing to do with the technology itself but the authorities who implemented that. The latest news is that the Central African Republic, one of the poorest countries in the world has also adopted bitcoin as a form of legal currency. It seems in the future we will see developed nations like Australia, the UK, USA (United States of America) may also adopt the same policy after overseeing the impact, or they could make their own currencies as we have seen in the case of China where they plan to create their own digital currency. Some economic analysts predict a tremendous change in crypto is forthcoming as institutional money enters the market. Moreover, there is the possibility that crypto will be floated on the Nasdaq, which would further add credibility to blockchain and its uses as an alternative to conventional currencies. </p>

    <h3>What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? </h3>

    <p>Previously we mentioned El Salvador became the first nation to recognise bitcoin as a form of legal transaction. It has been for 7.5 months and unfortunately it did not work out over there. Only 30 percent of the adult population downloaded the bitcoin wallet application which is too low compared to the number of downloads that were registered. To encourage users, a 30-dollar bonus was being given but however results reveal that users did not spend anymore beyond that 30 dollar that was given as a bonus money. Perhaps El Salvador is the prime example to portray the impact of this development. However, there could be other negative impacts due to the development of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies being bot regulated by a central authority poses a threat if it is used to buy weapons or used for human trafficking purposes in the dark web. Transactions done using debit cards are always recorded by the bank and therefore can be used to track in case of any wrongdoings. Also, cryptocurrencies are a vulnerable type of investment. It heavily relies on speculation and price can fluctuate. Interesting to know that cryptocurrencies have only been there for a decade and hence other forms of exchange like gold might still be preferable among the masses.  </p>

    <h3>Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h3>

    <p>We do not get to hear often on cryptocurrencies taking any current jobs, but as usual cryptocurrencies do have the potential to replace traditional cash. This is more likely to happen if more countries start recognising cryptocurrencies as a legitimate form of transaction. In this way, cash will lose its value. Should cryptocurrencies take over entirely, new infrastructure would have to be developed in order to allow the world to adapt. There would inevitably be difficulties with the transition, as cash could become incompatible quite quickly, leaving some people with lost assets. Established financial institutions would have to scramble to change their ways. Instead, we might new job titles will start to appear especially roles requiring people to have skills in maintaining the cryptocurrency infrastructure.  </p>

    <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h3>

    <p>If cryptocurrencies are legalised in Australia, then it will carry a significant impact in my daily activities. Just like any modern technology, it will be confusing initially. Maintaining a bitcoin wallet and doing transactions with it might feel odd initially as opposed to hear them when they were written theoretically. Everyday transactions that used to happen at the local café, marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay will soon start to offer separate payment facilities for cryptocurrencies holders. Already when we want to open a bank account, we are served with multiple options and each option has to offer their certain pros and cons. For example, NAB (National Australia Bank) has zero account fees forever on their Everyday Classic Banking account. Similarly in the same tone, we will get to witness multiple cryptocurrencies providers like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc showing their individual benefits. For instance, Bitcoin might provide a higher return on investment rather than Ethereum however when it comes to security, Ethereum might be safer than Bitcoin. Friends initially who remained sceptic about cryptocurrency might soon start to open their own wallets due to peer pressure and start flaunting their investments portfolio. We might get to see some local cryptocurrencies provider or even banks like NAB, ANZ, Westpac starts to make their own digital currency to remain competitive in the market. Since such banks are widely used by Australians, therefore it will make transitioning to cryptocurrencies easier for older Australians or family member like parents. Back in November 2021, CBA (Commonwealth Bank of Australia) announced that they will be the first Aussie bank to offer cryptocurrencies. CBA has partnered with one of the world’s largest regulated crypto exchanges and custodians, Gemini, and leading blockchain analysis firm, Chainalysis. Both partnerships have allowed the bank to design a crypto exchange and custody service that will be offered to customers through a new feature in the app. </p>

              <h2>
                Project Idea
              </h2>


              <h3>Overview</h3>

              <p>Our team have settled on creating a “beach app” for our project, as inspired by Mason Grahams original project idea. This "beach app” will be
              designed with beach goers and travellers in mind, helping people find the best beach that suits what they are looking for.
              We believe an app like this has large user potential as one thing Australia is known for is its beaches - attracting millions of Australians a year,
              with more popular ones such as Bondi Beach attracting plenty of tourists also. With Covid restrictions finally easing, we believe this would be the best time for such an app to emerge.
              The user will be able to search for beaches via distance (or by some other characteristic of their choosing) which will display a list of beaches.
              Selecting a beach will display a variety of information about that beach including things such as location, distance, pollution, water quality, scenery, dog friendly,
              busiest hours, lifeguard available, general user reviews (numerical and written), etc and an overall rating based on all these factors combined.
              The app would gather the information of each of these factors from the users rating/assessment (surveying), which would generate an average rating for each.
              The beaches would be gathered on demand via internet (so not via a locally stored database) therefor requiring an internet connection,
              although the beaches the user have previously searched up will be cached locally.
              </p>

              <h3>Motivation</h3>

              <p>
                Australia has many, many beaches, but how do you know which ones are good and which ones are bad? This is our primary motivation when it comes to the building and
                creating of our beach app. Our goal is to create an app that allows all Australians and Tourists alike to find the perfect beaches to them.
                This takes the form of allowing users to find the beaches most suited to them. With this beach app we aim to give everyone the best experience possible
                which is why we include an option to search for a beach based on the characteristics that they want in their summer experience.
                Do they want a quieter and more comfortable beach, maybe they want a more popular beach in order to meet people.
                We want to empower our users with the choice of what they think will suit them best.
                An additional motivation of our team is to encourage people to get out and start populating beaches again.
                This is in an effort to encourage the growth of Australia's various beaches that may be less popular than they were pre Covid.
                Many people may have no idea what beaches to go to post covid and which ones to avoid,
                this app may assist these kinds of people with up-to-date information that can assist them in finding what beaches are best in this post covid era.
              </p>

              <h3>Description</h3>

              <p>
                For the very first version of this app, we plan to include just a few features as a proof of concept to show what both the app and us as a group are capable of.
                What features will be included in the prototype is still to be decided, and will be agreed upon in the near future.
                The following is a list of the basic features that we wish to include, and how the app overall will function.<br><br>
              </p>

              <p>

                <b>Display a list of beaches by search criteria/filter descending or ascending:</b><br><br>
                Upon loading into the app, this will be the first thing the user sees.
                By default, it will simply display a vertical list of beaches sorted by nearest distance first.
                Each listing will have a basic picture, name of beach and the overall user rating. The user will also be able to view the beaches in a maps view,
                with each listed beach location having an marker over it.
                The user will have a variety of search filters to find what they are looking for easily which can be sorted by ascending or descending, that will include:
</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Location (eg: city or suburb)</li>
                  <li>Nearest distance</li>
                  <li>Alphabetical order</li>
                  <li>By the currently least or busiest beaches</li>
                  <li>User ratings for: water quality, pollution, scenery, overall/average</li>
                  <li>Lifeguard available</li>
                  <li>Dog friendly</li>
                </ul>


                <p>

                <br>
                We plan to implement this feature by using the Google Maps API (Google Maps Platform) to fetch the geo location data/the actual beaches themselves.
                As a result, this means the beaches that it will fetch will be entirely dependent on Google Maps, as if it is not listed on there then it won’t show up on our app.
                It would be possible to manually send out updates to add new beaches that aren’t listed on Google Maps, but for simplicity sakes we will not worry about that for now.
                <br><br>

                In order to avoid reliance on having a stable internet connection, all the beaches that were previously searched for (that is, the ones that the user have scrolled past)
                will be cached locally. This means in the event of having no internet connection, the user will still be able search something up.
                Although since this is being stored on the users phone then we need to consider storage space. We will probably cap the amount of data that can be cached at around 500MB by default,
                though this will be able to be configured by the user.

                </p>


                <p>
                <br><br>
                <b>Show relevant information about the selected beach:</b><br><br>
                Once the user has selected a beach, the listing page for that beach will show up providing a variety of information.
                The information that the user will be able to view is similar to the things they could filter by. These are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Image – a image of the beach fetched from Google to show the user what it looks like</li>
                  <li>Location – what suburb and city is it located in?</li>
                  <li>Distance – how far away is the beach?</li>
                  <li>*Peak hours – what are the most and least busiest hours for it (display in a bar chart possibly)</li>
                  <li>*User ratings for: pollution, water quality, scenery, user rating out of five, written user rating, an overall average rating for each of these things</li>
                  <li>*Lifeguard available – show if the beach has assigned lifeguards, if so when are they present? </li>
                  <li>*Dogs friendly – say if dogs are allowed at the beach and how good they are for dogsy</li>
                </ul>


                <p>
              <br>
              By default, what details can be fetched from Google will be displayed, although the main method of the characteristics marked with an asterisk being determined will by the users
              themselves. The user will be able to leave both a numerical review and a written review for these aspects,
              which the app will then generate some sort of average or total from the numerical review depending on the specific characteristic
              (meaning the written aspect will be optional).
              We plan for users to be able to upload images as part of their review as such a feature could help them convey a point or as further proof of their review.
              Since this is a very user driven app, a report feature must be included which is discussed more later on.



                </p>


<p>
                <br><br>
                <b>Maintaining security:</b><br><br>
                At the current stage, we’re going to require users to make an account in order to leave reviews.
                This may end up being a barrier and reduce the simplicity of fully utilizing the app, but we need a way to moderate user content.
                This means setting up a way for people to create accounts and storing the details on a server. This server will be setup on our end,
                and it will contain information pertaining to accounts and the reviews/user content. This means creating a database that the app will retrieve data from.
                We don’t exactly plan on reinventing the wheel, so we will simply opt for using mySQL with phpMyAdmin/MariaDB.
                This will run on a Raspberry Pi using Ubuntu until hardware needs increase.
                <br><br>
                Since account creation will be a thing, we must consider database and server security.
                Account passwords must be encrypted before they are stored into the database,
                as storing this sort of thing in plaintext is obviously a terrible idea.
                Since this will be an Android app, we will be able to use Java with something like BCrypt to encrypt the passwords –
                although if we wish to expand to iOS then Java may not be the ideal choice.
</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>
                <b>Appropriate reviews, moderation and reporting</b><br>
                Following on from prior features, we will need a system to ensure written reviews and uploaded images are “family friendly”,
                as in they do not contain anything inappropriate. The main things that would be deemed inappropriate include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Swearing</li>
                  <li>Abuse, including slurs and threats of violence</li>
                  <li>Spam, phishing links and advertisements</li>
                  <li>Sexual content</li>
                  <li>Spreading personal information about someone</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  There are two main ways we could go about automatically enforcing this.
                  The first is to have a list or “dictionary” of banned words, so a user would not be able to post a review containing these words – being asked to alter the content.
                  The second would be manual review by moderators, who take sufficient action which can range from removing the review or banning the user.
                  For this to work, we would need to include a report feature which would send a “ticket” to the moderators containing the post and report reason.
                  The report reason would simply be a dropdown menu of pre-determined options.
                </p>

                <br><br>


                <p>
                <b>Layout:</b> <br>
                While layout is not a feature like the others, it is still something very important to consider and will determine how many people will be attracted.
                The kind of people who would be interested in going to a beach is very broad, of nearly any age or general demographic.
                This means the layout needs to be very intuitive and accessible to everyone. It cannot contain “information overload” and only have the essentials present at once.
              </p>

              <h3>Tools & Technology</h3>

              <p>
                The tools and technology we will use to develop our app will be Java for the building of the Android app.<br><br>
                Swift for the iOS version of the app. We will use Firebase Firestore to store data related to the beaches.<br><br>
                Firebase Authentication for the authentication of new users. We will use either AWS Location Services or Google Maps API (whichever integrates easier/better).<br><br>
                Figma to use as the wireframe and to build and test our prototype.<br><br>
              </p>

              <h3>Skills Needed</h3>
              <p>
                To build this application, the development team needs skill in Mobile App Development. This could be better made into an Android App as deploying Android app is cheaper ($25 one-time payment to Google Play). Basic UI/UX skill will be required as the app does not seem too complicated. However, as the app is a beach-themed app, proper colour themes would serve a better user experience. To build the prototype and the wireframes for the application, skill in using <strong>Figma</strong> is necessary. Figma is a popular wireframe and prototype designing tool where wireframes could be designed using cross-collaboration. Other hand, Android applications could be built using <strong>Java or Kotlin</strong>. Kotlin unfortunately might be difficult to grasp hence Java is better suited as most team members will have this skill set as Java is usually taught in first year. On the other hand, the app requires users to sign up and then view the beaches which are supposed to be stored in a database. To make the job easier, <strong>Firebase</strong> is one such tool that could be used. Firebase Authentication shall be integrated with the Android App to make authentication secure and easier and Firestore Relational Databases could be integrated to store information related to sea-beach like opening times, accessibility information, etc. The IDE used to build this application would be Android Studio as it will have necessary third-party tools, documentation related to Android Development.
              </p>


              <h3>Outcome</h3>
              <p>
                The outcome of this application is designing a beach app which will be designed using mapping to create a rating system which the user can rate
                the beach they are at after locating the beach through the app using either a search bar or by using the application to locate the beach you are looking for.

              <p>
                Throughout the entire assignment, everyone was very friendly and cooperative with no arguments or disagreements ever really arising.
                They were fairly easy-going members to work alongside.
                While at the beginning communication wasn’t the greatest due to many members not checking the Microsoft Teams announcements/messages,
                 this would improve drastically after the first week or so with people regularly checking the announcements and communicating.

                An issue right up to the end was the amount of work that was being completed. The majority of the group did not end up finishing
                their assigned tasks until the last three days of the assignment actually being due (when a complete draft was meant to be finished a week before the due date).
                This made doing tasks that rely on other parts delayed or harder, such as the finalizing the website some aspects of the project idea.
                But some members may have had valid excuses to as why their parts were delayed (such as needing to defer). It also means that parts of my assigned tasks had to be rushed,
                to have more free time, to account for the scenario where people may not end up doing theirs, thus those tasks falling onto me and/or someone else
                (and explaining any potential bugs on the website side of things). This also forced us to submit a very first draft as there would have been no time at all to refine said first draft.
                In the future it will be very important to get members to start their tasks earlier and with consistent progress, even if it is just 2 or 3 sentences or a few lines of code a day.

              <p>
                See: Tools section. That is the version history of the docx file is a much better representation of group contributions.<br>
                I personally contributed the team profile (tests and jobs), the tools (setting up GitHub, organizing meetings, and creating the website)
                1 IT technology (cloud and servers) and the project overview and description
              </p>


              <u><h3>Kowsar Rahman</h3></u>

              <h3>What went well?</h3>

              <p>There was little or no disagreements between group mates and Chris being the group leader fairly divided the task allocation among us. As deadline was approaching, I could witness the seriousness of the group members by regularly attending meetings and responding to queries.  </p>

              <h3>What could be improved?</h3>

              <p>We were late in terms of finishing the draft. In fact, our tutor was a bit afraid of us however as soon as I discovered his message, I tried my level best to give him assurance that despite all we will still finish on time including the report and the website.</p>
              <p>Relying on only Teams for communication may not be an effective idea. Sure, most team members are active on Discord or other platforms where the frequency of checking messages/notifications are high compared to Teams. So, keeping in mind in future, we team members may choose to communicate on other platforms and be on time to avoid any doubts casted on us. Specially I personally apologise for any inconvenience. </p>

              <h3>At least one thing thatn was surprising?</h3>

              <p>Agree with Chris's opinion. Communication is important. No matter how talented the group members are, without proper communication there is no use of it. We all agree ideas transmit through communication and we people cannot read minds. More surprising was how overlooking deadline can lead to as it can mount pressure in the end.  </p>

              <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>

              <p>I have a considerable amount of experience in working with groups and have faced challenges and on some occasions overcame those too. Working in groups have taught me on how to invest faith on people. The emergence of covid changed how we meet resulting more meetings taking place on the virtual world. It is extremely impossible to micro-manage people on online although micro-managing is something is not done on real life as well. Hence, we trust on people to carry out their given tasks and when they do carry out, it is a moment of success as I discover that I can select the right people to do a particular work.  </p>

              <u><h3>Connor O'Loughlin</h3></u>

              <h3>What went well?</h3>
              <p>Things that went well within the group includes communication and general quality of work.
                In terms of communication this vastly improved overtime with frequent check ins and clarifications on what needed to be done.
                In terms of work quality this also seems to be in a good place with most questions being answered with a good level of depth.</p>

              <h3>What could be improved</h3>

              <p>In terms of what can be improved I believe that some group members could have communicated more and attempted to finish the work earlier than the due date.</p>

              <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>

              <p>I was surprised at how effectively some of us could do the work vs others and the various levels we were at with some people being finished
                well before the deadline whilst some worked right up until the deadline. This was also due to events that happened over the course of the allotted assignment
                time and how it affected our work flow.  </p>

              <h3>At least one thing you have learned about groups?</h3>

              <p>Through this project I have learnt how much effort it takes to keep other group members in line with everyone else and how
                it can be difficult to complete a project when it relies on the efforts of others.</p>


              <h3>Group activity/contribution</h3>
              <p>I contributed with the motivation section of the IT project idea and the Machine learning section of the IT technology part.</p>

              <u><h3>Sean Shlemoon</h3></u>

              <h3>What went well?</h3>
              <p>Overall, everyone within our group were extremely friendly and looked out for one another,
                as well as ensure to follow up with any members and see where their progress was.
                Based on the Teams conversations, everyone was coherent and knew exactly what to ask and provide solutions for. </p>

              <h3>What could be improved</h3>

              <p>As far as a group, everything was working well and smoothly, but the issue with communication was evident.
                Teams is a wonderful platform to collaborate and work on projects, but I feel that there could have been a better option to use rather than Teams.
                This is mostly an issue with the assignment requiring us to use Teams and not the performance of my fellow group members.
                Regarding myself, I need to improve on meeting deadlines and ensuring that everyone is aware of where I am at each stage of progress.
                I also need to start working on the designated parts of the assignment that were given to me much earlier,
                as I currently have a busy schedule outside of university and have to set aside the time to organise myself.
                I’ll definitely use this as a learning moment to ingrain it into my work ethic and consider proper assignment of tasks for myself.</p>

              <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>

              <p>The agreement across the group members was a pleasant surprise.
                Many times, there have been groups that I’ve been part of where there was nothing but disagreements amongst everyone.
                It is nice to have the same idea across different minds being projected and understood.
              </p>

              <h3>At least one thing you have learned about groups?</h3>

              <p>As I have worked with many different types of groups of individuals in the past, one thing that is common is the trust we have for each other to deliver their share of work.
                I have learned that this trust is important and is necessary for a group to progress with the assigned tasks at hand and to work with one another efficiently.
                The chemistry that we develop for one another is crucial in forming this trust, which is evident when communicating with each other.
                I’ve learned that group work requires lots of involvement and cooperation, which is something that I honestly have learned that I need to absolutely work on.
                I realised that I work best alone and without a group. The requirement of my work adds on pressure to myself and to those within the group,
                which is why I prefer to work solo and avoid having that additional constraint onto others. </p>


              <h3>Group activity/contribution</h3>

              <p>I was initially assigned the description section of our project idea as well as the IT technology of blockchain and cryptocurrency,
                but due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to complete them. I will be adding what I have completed as a separate attachment. </p>


              <u><h3>Nate Winter</h3></u>


              <h3>What went well?</h3>
              <p>
              Our group has been friendly and understanding and there haven’t been any major disagreements, complaints or altercations.
              We have become good at communicating with each other and keeping others up to date on what we are up to despite us failing to do this earlier in the project.
              </p>

              <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
              <p>
              Our motivation and our effort towards the quality and quantity of content that we make for our group assignments could be improved.
              Also, the efficiency and speed of us producing work can be worked on.
              For me personally, organising myself better and properly allocating time towards my parts is what I can improve on to make sure I can complete my parts on time.
              This is something I need to work on regardless but also something I need to work on in groups specifically in case someone depends on my parts being
              completed in any future assignment of mine.
            </p>



              <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>

              <p>
                I think it was surprising how quickly we improved on our communication and participation in this assignment.
                I was expecting it to be more awkward and take more time for us to get used to communicating properly with each other
                however I think we got much better at it than I thought we would.
              </p>


              <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>

              <p>
                Working in groups I think is very hard and I personally find it quite annoying as I learned that chemistry with teammates is an important factor in success.
                Despite most of our parts not depending on other people's parts, I found that whenever we had a lack of communication it was difficult to judge where others were up to,
                where we need to be and understand whether certain teammates were struggling or not. So, I learnt that team chemistry and constant,
                clear communication are very important factors to success
              </p>


              <h3>Group Acitivty/Contribution</h3>
              <p>I attended all teams meetings and all tutorials. I completed the IT Work section and the Tools and Technology section of the Project Idea</p>


              <h3>Overall Group Reflection</h3>



              <p>
                Upon discussion as a group, we all agree with each other's individual reflections of the group.<br><br>

              </p>

                <h3>What went well?</h3>

                <p>
                  While communication at the very beginning at the poor,
                  this improved near instantly after the first week with nearly everyone checking the Microsoft Teams announcements near instantly.
                  We’re glad that this was the case as if poor communication continued any longer than it did, then this assignment would have been even harder to complete.
                  Going forward in this class, university and in our potential careers we can all agree that nailing down effective communication immediately will be of utmost importance
                  <br><br>
                  As soon as we met each other we were all able to get along, work together and raise any concerns or criticisms straight away.
                  We’re all very glad this was the case in the end since the completion of this assignment was delayed,
                  and if we didn’t really get along it would have been debatable if this would have been completed at all.
                </p>


                <h3>What could be improved?</h3>

                <p>
                  The work ethic and general motivation was seriously lacking until the weekend that the assignment was due,
                  with only two members finishing their allocated tasks in a reasonable timeframe.
                  This made our work suffer a lot leading to a lower standard/quality of writing due to needing to rush and take on another member’s task last minute.
                  We have agreed to improve upon this aspect for assignment 3 where we implement our project, as that is going be a lot more work than this.
                  We will most likely ensure that we will be able to show off steady progress every week to keep on track and be able to have enough time to refine a draft
                  (in other words, time management). It is also important to get tasks finished on time as other members may rely on them.
                </p>

                <h3>At least one thing thatn was surprising?</h3>

                <p>
                  We were surprised at a few things; how important great communication is and how quickly that communication improved.
                  Even if you have some very smart and skilled people working with you, even the best of skills can quickly fall apart with regularly communicating with others.
                  We were also surprised truly how much you can get done in a group when a deadline is on your doorstep alongside with its consequences,
                  although we can safely say this is not an ideal way of doing things and we would not want it to happen again
                </p>


                <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>

                  <p>
                    Going off on what was surprising, we learnt that communication and organisation is key to success and if that aspect isn’t nailed and perfected straight away then
                    it will make our lives immensely harder and lead to a worse result.
                    Many of us at first assumed that we could still get by communication was “fine” and not amazing, which we soon realised was very wrong.
                    Everyone needs to know where others are at, so we can plan accordingly and account for worse case scenarios.
                  </p>
