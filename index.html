  <h3>Chris Turner - s3931227</h3>

  <p>Chris is 21 years old and has started to study for the Bachelor of IT this year. He comes from an English background with their dad being born in the United Kingdom.
    His hobbies include the usual nerd type stuff such as video games, anime and has enjoyed learning 3D modelling + programming for the past few years on the side.
    They have had a long-term interest in IT since they were 13 years old with their main IT interests being in object orientated programming, computer hardware and reverse engineering of retro software.
    Chris went to study a Certificate IV in Information Technology in 2020, and then a Diploma of Software Development in 2021 – both at a TAFE, which is the only ‘formal’ IT experience they have.

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    The key take aways from this test to keep in mind while working in a group is the introverted aspect.
    Working in a group requires all team members to be active and actively communication with each other,
    solving problems and resolve any conflict that may arise which is the opposite of what an introvert would ‘enjoy’ so to say.
    It’s possible that the agreeableness is a major trait as they wish to avoid that sort of confrontation, which at the same time may make it hard to provide constructive criticism.
    It will be important to get out of this comfort zone of being introverted in order to work efficiently as a group,
    but other team members should also keep in mind this is a foreign/uncomfortable experience for the person as to not too harshly judge them.
    Being overly self-critical may delay how soon the work gets completed also, which other team members will rely on.
  </p>

  <h3>Connor O’Loughlin – s3949499</h3>

  <p>
    Connor has recently moved to Melbourne in the last few months in order to study at RMIT for the Bachelor of Information Technology.
    He is an avid fan of video games enjoys watching the occasional TV series.
    Connors interest in IT started quite recently when he took Applied Computing: Software Development in VCE last year where he enjoyed the programming aspect the most.
    The bulk of his current IT knowledge stems from classes he has took in the past where he learnt about different design concepts and a surface level know how of Python.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9EDh5rc.png" alt="bigfive-connor">
    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    Two of the major characteristics of this team member to keep in mind is the ambitiousness and at the same time how ‘unfocused’ they may be.
    As this will all be leading to implementing a project idea, it is vital to not come up with an idea that will be overly ambitious for our skill set,
    and also not get ambitious with the features in each stage of development.
    Being unfocused also means that they may forget or lack the motivation to keep up a consistent work ethic in a heavily team-based effort
    (meaning they may need an occasional reminder/push to keep at it). This would also not be a very good pairing with being overly ambitious.
    This member also scored highly on intellect/imagination which is the exact sort of trait you need in a field of problem solving, which will be a valuable asset.

  <h3>Mason Graham – s3953383</h3>
  <p>
    Mason has lived his life in Victoria, coming from a Scottish and Maltese background with their parents moving to Australia in the 1950s as migrants.
    He completed his VCE in 2021 and was able to secure a place at RMIT to study the Bachelor of Information Technology.
    Mason has always had a love for footy and cricket since he was young but has a history of being diagnosed with scoliosis in year 7 and hearing struggles.
    Despite being an outdoors person, he still has had an interest in IT since he was around 14 with a stark interest in the military and governmental applications of computing.
    His prior IT interest comes form studying related fields in VCE, carefully reading the textbooks.

    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    From looking at the test results, it can be concluded that they are a much more independent/individual learner, introverted and empathetic to others around them.
    Having strong independence and individuality means that they will not have to rely heavily on other team members to complete their tasks,
    but at the same time they could be too independent and thus may not communicate clearly enough with their team often enough,
    leaving other members confused or unsure how the overall project is coming along or what they are doing.
    Empathy will be a good characteristic to have as it may mean that they will be easy going if not helpful to members who are struggling,
    helping the team to get along and keep up the pace of the work.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h3>Nate Winter – s3948929</h3>

  <p>
    Nate is a born and raised Australian in a family of 5, with an ancestral history stemming from multiple western European cultures.
    With a diverse family history, Nate enjoys learning different languages, studying Japanese throughout all of high school and is keen to start learning German.
    He has been a fan of videos games since he was only 5 years old, playing them to this very day. His interest in IT started at the same time as his interest in video games,
    finding that he enjoyed tinkering with computers, modifying video games and helping his family with any technical issues that they may have.
    In high school Nate enjoyed taking software development subjects which he could foresee doing as a career,
    and wishes to learn about popular languages like C#, C++ and Swift. He also has a side interest in security and networking, spending time outside of school learning about these things.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XytbEYG.png" alt="bigfive-mason">
    <br>


    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    From these results, Nate can be interpreted as a shy and introverted person, but still very empathetic, understanding and a team player. \
    Like with Mason, this member will be able to understand other members and if they’re struggling, not become frustrated if they are falling behind if not offer to help.
    It also shows that they can be quite self-critical and pessimistic which is both good and bad.
    The good is that it means that their work will that of a high standard and will be able to come up with constructive criticism,
    but may become overwhelmed with critical thoughts and wish to give up which will be important for other team members to keep in mind.
    They may also need help with poor self discipline, needing that occasional push himself.

  </p>

  <h3>Sean Shlemoon – s3660535</h3>

  <p>
    Sean was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan over in the United States with an Assyrian background which is an ethnic/cultural group originating from the Syria/Iraq/Turkey area of the Middle East.
    Sean enjoys programming (testing out different languages and their best applications), learning about the history of different cultures,
    playing video games and creating a potential business plan for the future. Sean’s interest in IT has been there since he was 10 years old,
    being deemed the family “technician” always learning new IT concepts and experimenting (which serves as his prior IT experience).
    His main IT interests revolve around software engineering and cybersecurity due to how much of the current world relies on these areas of specialty.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VZpQ27Y.pngg" alt="bigfive-sean">
    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    The most notable result from these tests is the conscientiousness aspect. This means that someone is very diligent, thorough and generally a hard worker.
    There is a very good chance this means that other team members will always be able to rely on them to do a great job.
    Openness was another important aspect which may very much mean that they’ll always be open to what they are thinking about the task at hand
    which is a vital thing to have as working in a team means being open to discussion and criticism. These characteristics would make a great candidate for a team leader,
    and someone you will be able to rely on.

  <h3>Kowsar Rahman - s3825159</h3>

  <p>
    Kowsar is a passionate student originally from Bangladesh who began studying at RMIT in 2019, and is now in his third year of the Bachelor of Computer Science.
    He discovered his love for IT when he was in year 8, taking a keen interest in web development using languages such as PHP hoping to publish a finished app.
    This has evolved to additionally knowing Java, JavaScript and Python.

    </tr>
  </table>

  </p>
  <p>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    Kowsar is the most unique out of this team, getting the Architect (INTJ). This implies that he has a more intuitive, thinking/analytical and critical ways of thinking.
    These things could be a massive benefit to the team such as the analytical and intuition aspects, especially when it comes to the implementing the project.
    Creating an IT related project (such as an app) requires an extended amount of careful planning, thinking of how the implementation plan should be structured,
    how they would go about doing it and developing it. These sorts of skills require a very logical way of thinking,
    with the critical and pessimistic aspects helping to keeps things to a feasible/realistic scale, discovering any flaws in the plan to as what wouldn’t really work out,
    and are generally great ways of thinking when it comes to creating an IT related idea (such as with programming).
    Kowsar would be a valuable asset when it comes to development.

  <h2>Group Processes</h2>
  <p>In assignment 2 our group faced some difficulties, some which were out of our control (personal issues, people leaving, etc) however some of our issues were ones that we could improve on.
    Our biggest issue was communication. As a group we would either have dishonest communication or little to no communication at all
    which made it hard to catch up with everyone and check where everyone was at. Moving forward in our group we will need to focus on clear
    consistent communication so that our progress is clear and defined but also so we can see where every group member is at with their work. </p>

  <h2>
    Team Profile - Ideal Jobs
  </h2>



  <h3>Chris Turner – Penetration Tester </h3>
  <p>
    The ideal job for Chris is that of a “penetration tester” or otherwise known as an “ethical hacker”.
    The role of a penetration hacker tester is to perform authorised security tests on computer systems/networks
    in order to find any security vulnerabilities which may lead to sensitive data getting leaked or finances best stolen.
    Chris plans on obtaining these skills by continuing to pick relevant courses in higher education, picking up relevant internships when possible,
    self-study via a combination of textbooks and online courses and attempting to complete previous exams/papers sourced from not only RMIT but other universities
    out there when they feel confident enough.
  </p>


  <h3>Connor O’Loughlin - Systems Analyst/Software Developer</h3>

  <p>
    Connors ideal job is to be a systems analyst. The purpose of a systems analyst is to analyse computers and systems in use of the client,
    determining the best software and hardware to use for the client's needs. This also includes maintenance so everything is up to date,
    working as expected and looking for anything that could be improved upon to improve efficiency of the client. Many system analysts are also programmers,
    creating any specialised piece of software that they may need.
    His plan for achieving a role like this by learning intermediate python skills, improving design and presentation skills,
    and user orientated development via university courses. For the mathematics aspects (statistical modelling)
    he may need to study outside of university for this using whatever resources that can be found on the internet.
    The remainder of the needed skills planned to be picked up naturally as he progresses through university.
  </p>

  <h3>Kowsar Rahman – Full Stack Developer </h3>

  <p>
    Kowsar wishes to become a full stack developer in the future. A full stack dev is simply someone who develops both the back-end side of software
    (the technical side of things the end user doesn’t see, such as the code or the database) and the front end (most often the stuff the user does see, like the UI/UX with HTML and CSS).
    It’s what a lot of people think of when they hear “programmer”.
    Kowsar is already in his final year of university completing many courses and projects both part of university and on the side for fun,
    meaning he already has many of the skills needed for such a role. His skills could be further refined by further developing more complex projects on the side,
    attending “code-a-thon" type events and taking on advanced programming and interview challenges (with websites such as Coderbyte or Leetcode).

  </p>

  <h3>Mason Graham – Systems Administrator/Cyber Security Specialist </h3>

  <p>

    Mason aims to become a systems administrator, hoping to go on to specialise in cyber security related fields.
    A systems admin is the main person responsible for upkeeping and configuring the computer systems and their network.
    This also includes protecting the data stored on the network (hence the cyber security desire).
    Masons wants to get the skills needed by continuing to attend university and picking relevant courses
    over the course of 3 years but also gain experience by taking internships and gaining further understanding (unspecified).
  </p>

  <h3>Nate Winter – Senior Game Development Tools Developer </h3>

  <p>
    Due to Nates passion for video games, he would seek out to become a software developer in the video game industry,
    developing third party tools that game developers over the world use. An example of these tools could be an audio editing piece of software that
    lets audio engineers and programmers build and implement complex audio systems in a variety of game engines (eg: FMOD).
    He has stated that he would prefer to complete a Bachelor of Computer Science as the required skills needed would naturally come through that.
    He would also pick relevant courses and electives in object orientated programming, looking for an opportunity to learn the Unity engine via online documentation and videos,
    and to look for a more entry level game development job upon graduating.
  </p>

  <h3>Sean Shlemoon – Software Engineer</h3>

  <p>
    Seans ideal job would be something akin to a software engineer at a silicon valley type company (such as Google).
    This is developing their websites or applications that are used by millions of people around the world on a daily basis,
    with Google also utilizing and coming up with some of the most innovative technology out there.
    Sean has stated that he plans to gain the skills needed by continuing to study at university,
    self-studying a wide variety of programming languages via online courses or “bootcamps” (at the moment, Java and JavaScript) and hours of hard work.
  </p>

  <div id="CareerPlans">
  <h2>Career Plans</h2>
<p>
  None of our team’s career plans or ideal jobs have changed since our completion of Assignment 2 and the feedback we got from it.
  Looking at our career plans more in depth we can see that many of our ideal jobs are similar but still different.
  The only two ideal jobs that are vastly different from the rest are Chris and Nate’s being senior game development tools developer and penetration tester respectively.
  For Nate, his strong interest in video games is apparent from his ideal job choice which also reflects his interest in getting into the game development scene.
   Chris on the other hand has a stronger interest in networks and cybersecurity and rather than developing security systems,
   he would like to study them and learn how to exploit them for the purpose of securing them and making them better.
    Because Chris and Nate’s ideal jobs and pathways are very different from the rest of the group it is difficult to contrast or compare them to the others.
    The only thing that can be observed is that Nate will most likely take some of the same paths as Kowsar and Connor
    as he improves his knowledge of programming but will eventually divert to game development. Chris on the other hand will take similar paths as Kowsar and Sean but
    instead focusing more of security and networks rather than user design.
  <br><br>
  This leaves us with Sean, Kowsar and Connor whose ideal jobs are software engineer, full stack developer and systems analyst/software developer. Kowsar’s ideal job is a full stack developer which entails that his pathway will need to make sure he learns user design, HTML and CSS to a high standard without neglecting the back end of development such as programming and databases. Sean will also need to learn a variety of skills such as user design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more to ensure he can achieve his ideal job as a software engineer at Silicon Valley. However, because Sean doesn’t intend to be a full stack developer, he could choose to focus his efforts in specific areas and specialize in them. Connor on the other hand will need to focus on user design and programming skills as well as other skills he may need to pick up outside of this course regarding mathematical analysis. From this we can see that all three of these members will need to improve their skills in programming and web development (to different degrees) however each have their own differences. For Kowsar he needs to learn every aspect of development (front end and back end), Connor may need to divulge in other studies to improve analysis skills and Sean has a choice of either specializing in something he specifically enjoys or is good at or could take a similar path as Kowsar in becoming a full stack developer.
  </p>

  <p>

    This knowledge could be applied to how we go on about future tasks, mainly the project itself.
    If we are to develop an app or website, then that task would for the most part be handed off to the members who are interested in heavily software development orientated jobs.
    Meanwhile the more logistical and any security or network side of things could be handed off to the remainder. It is best to hand off tasks that relate to people’s ideal jobs and interests,
    as that would mean they would enjoy doing it thus having more motivation to get a high standard of work done and sooner.
    Overall the group does have a lot in common when it comes to ideal jobs with similar interests and careers.
    They should be able to comfortably understand most potential concepts and terminology that are likely to be brought up.
    The group should be able to get along and work together well.

  <p>
    For this project, we again set up a website including all the information in the report that each member has the ability to contribute/push changes to.
    The repository also includes all the files for our artifacts towards the project implementation.

    The best way to gauge each team members progress/contribution is to look at the version history of the docx file on SharePoint combined,
    looking at who has pushed changes to the git and eventually the contribution sheet that will be filled out upon completion of this project.
    Some members pushed to the git while others stuck to uploading things to Microsoft Teams and then having someone else to push it
    (as we believe this would have been the most simple/streamlined course of action) or just editing the report document on Microsoft Teams.
    The git trail is not the best way to represent each individual member's contribution.
</p>

  <div id="GroupProcesses">
<h2>Group Processes and Communications</h2>
<p>We once again opted to use Microsoft Teams to facilitate communications and meetings every Wednesday and two-hour face-to-face meetings every Friday.
  We believe two meetings a week will be sufficient as a minimum, with the Friday one normally being longer and correcting any issues or problems that were brought up on the Wednesday.
  If anything immediately urgent comes up, we will be able to schedule a sudden meeting or talk about it through the announcements on MS Teams via text.
  We also decided to end up using Discord as a back and in cases where we need communication and responses ASAP.
<br><br>
If the worst-case scenario were to happen and we lose contact with a team member, then we will have to exhaust all possible avenues of contact including MS Teams, Email, and Canvas if possible. </p>

<p>For our team project we are attempting to make a beach app that allows users to find the beach that is right for them. This app will have various features such as filtering and search options based on location, popularity. </p>
<br>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Australia has many, many beaches, but how do you know which ones are good and which ones are bad? This is our primary motivation when it comes to the building and creating of our beach app. Our goal is to create an app that allows all Australians and Tourists alike to find the perfect beaches to them. This takes the form of allowing users to find the beaches most suited to them. With this beach app we aim to give everyone the best experience possible which is why we include an option to search for a beach based on the characteristics that they want in their summer experience. Do they want a quieter and more comfortable beach, maybe they want a more popular beach in order to meet people. We want to empower our users with the choice of what they think will suit them best.
<br><br>
An additional motivation of our team is to encourage people to get out and start populating beaches again. This is to encourage the growth of Australia's various beaches that may be less popular than they were pre Covid. Many people may have no idea what beaches to go to post covid and which ones to avoid, this app may assist these kinds of people with up-to-date information that can assist them in finding what beaches are best in this post covid era.
<br><br>
Landscape:
<br>
In terms of similar products, the range of competitors is vastly limited. However, there is one competitor that has been found is the “BeachSafe” app, this app tracks similar information like attendance and statistics relating to the beach and weather itself. Where our applications differ however is regarding the uses of each app ours differs slightly with the BeachSafe app showing the closest beach that is safe and patrolled whereas our app is more focused on giving a more holistic view of the various beaches in Australia. </p>

<h3>Aims</h3>
<p>For our project our aim is to build a functional prototype of our app in android studio. To do this we will also need to make UI wireframes in figma, database model, XAMPP server and database implementation, use case diagrams and a process flowchart. The UI wireframe will allow us to create artifacts of our application in case we don’t end up completing the full app and it also will help picture and design how the UI will be in the app. Both process flowchart and use case diagrams will give us additional artifacts and will also specify how the code and database will be designed. </p>


<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>

<p>For our project, we decided to go with a beach application that is all about finding the ideal beach site that suits the user’s needs and whether they would recommend it to other beach goers. It will be able to locate a certain type of beach that is based on a particular set of search criteria provided by the user and will give a list of the most suitable beaches within a given location proximate to the user. The app will also be able to give the user the ability to leave reviews of the different beach sites that they visit and in addition take and upload photos of the beach for other users to check when searching for their own ideal beach. The search criteria are a crucial part of the application, as it is the main function of the application in producing the specific beach the user had in mind. At this stage, we are at the beginning of development for the application. We will be utilizing Android Studio as the framework for the app and it will be written in Java. As part of our prototype development, we have decided to go ahead and utilize Figma as the UI presentation of what we envision the layout will look like. Using Figma helps us out tremendously in seeing what the end product would look like for the app UI and allows us to make any changes we see fit necessary. As for the usability and functionality of the app, we are currently going through the developmental process and will be providing updates as we advance. For each group member, we had assigned certain tasks to one another for completion. Chris had the tools and project (roles, time planning/deadlines, communications) sections of the report, mentioning the several types of applications we were using for the development of the app and the overall structure of the project report. Connor was responsible for the tools and technology section as well as the overview part of the report, in addition he was also the creator for our prototype using Figma. I was responsible for the risks, scopes and limits, testing, plans and progress sections of the description for our report. Nate had the aims section for the project description and the team profile. Kowsar was assigned the skills and jobs portion of the report as well as the contributing collaborator on GitHub for the development of the beach application. Prior to deciding to go with a beach app, as a team we initially considered creating a video game. We had assigned certain tasks to each other and really started to provide ideas for the game such as artwork for the backgrounds, a scoring system, save system, as well as a database to store the information required. We were planning to use Android Studio and wanted to create it as a 2D platformer video game but as the days went by, we immediately realized that we were unable to continue with the idea as it would have been time consuming and additionally, we had little experience with Java.
</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>
<p>
For this project, we aimed to have the roles akin to:

Chris Turner – Project management, database designer

Connor O’Louglin - User Interface Designer

Nate Winter – User Interface programmer

Sean Shlemoon – Use Case + Tester

Kowsar Rahman – Lead software developer



The justification for these tried to play to people’s strengths. For example, Chris has been the team leader and organized much of the logistics to this point with good success,
Kowsar has extensive experience developing software and Connor has a more artistic/creative leaning side which would be good for user interfaces.
The roles of Nate and Sean weren’t assigned necessarily with any strengths or their ideal jobs in mind as we couldn’t find any suitable tasks.

Although these roles didn’t end up being set in stone. This could be attributed to life obligations getting in the way, poor project management,
not keeping up with deadlines and not having a very clear vision to as how we were going to go about developing the project.
</p>
<h3>Scopes and Limits</h3>
<p>
As with any project we come across, our actions will determine what will be completed and what will be left out from development.
The amount of arduous work and dedication we put into creating this application will be the same amount in culmination that we will receive from it.
Of course, the only thing preventing us from finishing every feature we wish to include is the time we have available.
Our app, as simplistic and trivial as it may be, has the possibility to possess many distinctive functions and features that will enhance the beach going experience for the user.
The problem comes from false promises we make to ourselves and to others on delivering those said features and overcommitting to its capabilities.
In order to avoid as much of this as possible, we have set certain limits to the development of the app and ensure our priorities are not out of hand.
One of those limits that we have in mind is the user’s ability to save their favorite beach spots as well as giving the user the search criteria selection.
We will not be able to have an overall search of different beach sites across all of Australia, but we will show the map spots of highly rated beaches listed on Google.
Using Google Maps API, we can also display the map integrated with our UI and have a navigation bar at the bottom that will allow the storage of ideal beach sites.
The app itself would be a skeletal prototype with considerably basic functionality,
since at this stage a fully-fledged out beach application would be time consuming in including the distinct functions Google offers with its API.
</p>
<h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
<p>
The tools and technologies needed for this project include Java (the programming language), Google maps platform, Android studio and Figma. In this group both Christopher and Kowsar have experience with Java as a programming language and as Java is an open-source programming language no license is needed for the use of this technology in our project. In terms of Figma, all members of our group should have at least an idea of what it is with variable ranges of experience due to it being used for our UCD course, this may exclude Kowsar as he is from a computer science degree and may not have taken the class. Conceptually, Google maps platform may be needed in this project and does require payment to use certain features, nobody in our group has prior existing experience in the usage of this platform and it is unknown whether it is truly required for this project. Finally android studio is another technology that is required for our project. In this group Kowsar has demonstrated that they already have some pre-existing knowledge of how to use this technology. In terms of licenses required for the use of this technology, no license is needed apart from a one-time $25 registration fee that is required to upload an app to the Google Play Store, however, as we are only creating a prototype of said app there is no need for such a license to be paid.
</p>


<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
When it comes to how exactly we will be testing our project, one of the most basic ways is while we are writing the code for the application. During programming, we will be running debug sessions if we come across a coding issue that does not seem to have a solution initially. As a group, and especially those with some coding background familiar with the language being used, we will come together and go through each line of code until we figure out what is causing the whole project to stop working. As we progress further in development, we will produce a trivial prototype that will still have the basic functionality of the final product but will not be as clean and practical as we intend. The purpose of this prototype would be to see how the app works in a real-world situation with genuine users interacting with it. The users that will test the app will be a combination of people we know and are familiar with, random strangers that are willing to give a quick play through, those who are avid beach travelers, and those who simply like the user interface and would want it to be implemented onto other industries. This will provide us with realistic data that can be utilized in finding out what is being perceived positively and what can be flushed out of the system if the reception is poor. The testing protocol will be implemented throughout the course of the development of the application, mostly because it will keep us sharp and honest about the functionality of the app and allows us to find any issues that may exist at a much earlier stage rather than before we launch the product.
</p>

<h3>Timeframe/Deadlines</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LFZlk3G.png" alt="timeframetable">
<br>
We assigned these tasks based on our strengths and weaknesses as touched upon in the “Roles” section, but also taking into account that all but one has no experience whatsoever planning software projects or to as how the development life cycle works. We also had to consider that we didn’t have the chance to start on this project earlier, giving us a late start. We were not sure to put on future weeks after the submission deadline as again, nearly all of us have zero experience in software development, what to expect or how to break the tasks down. Development on the software side of things advanced faster than expected seeing as how we handed that off to the person with actual experience.
</p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>
  There are a few risks that we may come across when developing this beach application. One example could be the focus we have had on creating this app with the intention of it being only available for smartphones and having a mobile UI. Since the app is centered around the environment of a beach, most if not all beach goers are bringing their phones with them. This justifies the focus for a mobile app, but it can be a dangerous approach if we decide to not also include a webpage that is similar in presenting the information akin to a travel agency website. Another risk worth mentioning is in regard to the actual development of the application. We have run into several issues of understanding the different programming languages that we have at our disposal and whether they have the capability to execute the various features we wish to have as part of the app. Ensuring that we fully understand the language we use to create the app is crucial and a fundamental part of the developmental process. We could mention plenty of other risks that can potentially cause mayhem, but one important subject to cover is the risk of a serious security violation. Any type of breach in security that can cause harm to the user and expose their personal information and data is something we must take into consideration, and one solution that we decided to go with is the anonymous factor of leaving behind reviews. This allows the user to not have any association to their experience at any beach that they visit, thus preventing any sensitive information being leaked.
</p>

              <h3>What went well?</h3>
              <p>
                Throughout the entire assignment, everyone was very friendly and cooperative with no arguments or disagreements ever really arising.
                They were fairly easy-going members to work alongside.
                While at the beginning communication wasn’t the greatest due to many members not checking the Microsoft Teams announcements/messages,
                 this would improve drastically after the first week or so with people regularly checking the announcements and communicating.
              </p>

              <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
              <p>
                An issue right up to the end was the amount of work that was being completed. The majority of the group did not end up finishing
                their assigned tasks until the last three days of the assignment actually being due (when a complete draft was meant to be finished a week before the due date).
                This made doing tasks that rely on other parts delayed or harder, such as the finalizing the website some aspects of the project idea.
                But some members may have had valid excuses to as why their parts were delayed (such as needing to defer). It also means that parts of my assigned tasks had to be rushed,
                to have more free time, to account for the scenario where people may not end up doing theirs, thus those tasks falling onto me and/or someone else
                (and explaining any potential bugs on the website side of things). This also forced us to submit a very first draft as there would have been no time at all to refine said first draft.
                In the future it will be very important to get members to start their tasks earlier and with consistent progress, even if it is just 2 or 3 sentences or a few lines of code a day.
              </p>

              <h3>Group Acitivity/Contribution</h3>
              <p>
                See: Tools section. That is the version history of the docx file is a much better representation of group contributions.<br>
                I personally contributed the team profile (tests and jobs), the tools (setting up GitHub, organizing meetings, and creating the website)
                1 IT technology (cloud and servers) and the project overview and description
              </p>


              <u><h3>Kowsar Rahman</h3></u>

              <h3>What went well?</h3>

              <p>There was little or no disagreements between group mates and Chris being the group leader fairly divided the task allocation among us. As deadline was approaching, I could witness the seriousness of the group members by regularly attending meetings and responding to queries.  </p>

              <h3>What could be improved?</h3>

              <p>We were late in terms of finishing the draft. In fact, our tutor was a bit afraid of us however as soon as I discovered his message, I tried my level best to give him assurance that despite all we will still finish on time including the report and the website.</p>
              <p>Relying on only Teams for communication may not be an effective idea. Sure, most team members are active on Discord or other platforms where the frequency of checking messages/notifications are high compared to Teams. So, keeping in mind in future, we team members may choose to communicate on other platforms and be on time to avoid any doubts casted on us. Specially I personally apologise for any inconvenience. </p>

              <h3>At least one thing thatn was surprising?</h3>

              <p>Agree with Chris's opinion. Communication is important. No matter how talented the group members are, without proper communication there is no use of it. We all agree ideas transmit through communication and we people cannot read minds. More surprising was how overlooking deadline can lead to as it can mount pressure in the end.  </p>

              <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>

              <p>I have a considerable amount of experience in working with groups and have faced challenges and on some occasions overcame those too. Working in groups have taught me on how to invest faith on people. The emergence of covid changed how we meet resulting more meetings taking place on the virtual world. It is extremely impossible to micro-manage people on online although micro-managing is something is not done on real life as well. Hence, we trust on people to carry out their given tasks and when they do carry out, it is a moment of success as I discover that I can select the right people to do a particular work.  </p>

              <u><h3>Connor O'Loughlin</h3></u>

              <h3>What went well?</h3>
              <p>Things that went well within the group includes communication and general quality of work.
                In terms of communication this vastly improved overtime with frequent check ins and clarifications on what needed to be done.
                In terms of work quality this also seems to be in a good place with most questions being answered with a good level of depth.</p>

              <h3>What could be improved</h3>

              <p>In terms of what can be improved I believe that some group members could have communicated more and attempted to finish the work earlier than the due date.</p>

              <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>

              <p>I was surprised at how effectively some of us could do the work vs others and the various levels we were at with some people being finished
                well before the deadline whilst some worked right up until the deadline. This was also due to events that happened over the course of the allotted assignment
                time and how it affected our work flow.  </p>

              <h3>At least one thing you have learned about groups?</h3>

              <p>Through this project I have learnt how much effort it takes to keep other group members in line with everyone else and how
                it can be difficult to complete a project when it relies on the efforts of others.</p>


              <h3>Group activity/contribution</h3>
              <p>I contributed with the motivation section of the IT project idea and the Machine learning section of the IT technology part.</p>

              <u><h3>Sean Shlemoon</h3></u>

              <h3>What went well?</h3>
              <p>Overall, everyone within our group were extremely friendly and looked out for one another,
                as well as ensure to follow up with any members and see where their progress was.
                Based on the Teams conversations, everyone was coherent and knew exactly what to ask and provide solutions for. </p>

              <h3>What could be improved</h3>

              <p>As far as a group, everything was working well and smoothly, but the issue with communication was evident.
                Teams is a wonderful platform to collaborate and work on projects, but I feel that there could have been a better option to use rather than Teams.
                This is mostly an issue with the assignment requiring us to use Teams and not the performance of my fellow group members.
                Regarding myself, I need to improve on meeting deadlines and ensuring that everyone is aware of where I am at each stage of progress.
                I also need to start working on the designated parts of the assignment that were given to me much earlier,
                as I currently have a busy schedule outside of university and have to set aside the time to organise myself.
                I’ll definitely use this as a learning moment to ingrain it into my work ethic and consider proper assignment of tasks for myself.</p>

              <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>

              <p>The agreement across the group members was a pleasant surprise.
                Many times, there have been groups that I’ve been part of where there was nothing but disagreements amongst everyone.
                It is nice to have the same idea across different minds being projected and understood.
              </p>

              <h3>At least one thing you have learned about groups?</h3>

              <p>As I have worked with many different types of groups of individuals in the past, one thing that is common is the trust we have for each other to deliver their share of work.
                I have learned that this trust is important and is necessary for a group to progress with the assigned tasks at hand and to work with one another efficiently.
                The chemistry that we develop for one another is crucial in forming this trust, which is evident when communicating with each other.
                I’ve learned that group work requires lots of involvement and cooperation, which is something that I honestly have learned that I need to absolutely work on.
                I realised that I work best alone and without a group. The requirement of my work adds on pressure to myself and to those within the group,
                which is why I prefer to work solo and avoid having that additional constraint onto others. </p>


              <h3>Group activity/contribution</h3>

              <p>I was initially assigned the description section of our project idea as well as the IT technology of blockchain and cryptocurrency,
                but due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to complete them. I will be adding what I have completed as a separate attachment. </p>


              <u><h3>Nate Winter</h3></u>


              <h3>What went well?</h3>
              <p>
              Our group has been friendly and understanding and there haven’t been any major disagreements, complaints or altercations.
              We have become good at communicating with each other and keeping others up to date on what we are up to despite us failing to do this earlier in the project.
              </p>

              <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
              <p>
              Our motivation and our effort towards the quality and quantity of content that we make for our group assignments could be improved.
              Also, the efficiency and speed of us producing work can be worked on.
              For me personally, organising myself better and properly allocating time towards my parts is what I can improve on to make sure I can complete my parts on time.
              This is something I need to work on regardless but also something I need to work on in groups specifically in case someone depends on my parts being
              completed in any future assignment of mine.
            </p>



              <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>

              <p>
                I think it was surprising how quickly we improved on our communication and participation in this assignment.
                I was expecting it to be more awkward and take more time for us to get used to communicating properly with each other
                however I think we got much better at it than I thought we would.
              </p>


              <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>

              <p>
                Working in groups I think is very hard and I personally find it quite annoying as I learned that chemistry with teammates is an important factor in success.
                Despite most of our parts not depending on other people's parts, I found that whenever we had a lack of communication it was difficult to judge where others were up to,
                where we need to be and understand whether certain teammates were struggling or not. So, I learnt that team chemistry and constant,
                clear communication are very important factors to success
              </p>


              <h3>Group Acitivty/Contribution</h3>
              <p>I attended all teams meetings and all tutorials. I completed the IT Work section and the Tools and Technology section of the Project Idea</p>


              <h3>Overall Group Reflection</h3>



              <p>
                Upon discussion as a group, we all agree with each other's individual reflections of the group.<br><br>

                  While communication at the very beginning at the poor,
                  this improved near instantly after the first week with nearly everyone checking the Microsoft Teams announcements near instantly.
                  We’re glad that this was the case as if poor communication continued any longer than it did, then this assignment would have been even harder to complete.
                  Going forward in this class, university and in our potential careers we can all agree that nailing down effective communication immediately will be of utmost importance
                  <br><br>
                  As soon as we met each other we were all able to get along, work together and raise any concerns or criticisms straight away.
                  We’re all very glad this was the case in the end since the completion of this assignment was delayed,
                  and if we didn’t really get along it would have been debatable if this would have been completed at all.
                </p>


                <h3>What could be improved?</h3>

                <p>
                  The work ethic and general motivation was seriously lacking until the weekend that the assignment was due,
                  with only two members finishing their allocated tasks in a reasonable timeframe.
                  This made our work suffer a lot leading to a lower standard/quality of writing due to needing to rush and take on another member’s task last minute.
                  We have agreed to improve upon this aspect for assignment 3 where we implement our project, as that is going be a lot more work than this.
                  We will most likely ensure that we will be able to show off steady progress every week to keep on track and be able to have enough time to refine a draft
                  (in other words, time management). It is also important to get tasks finished on time as other members may rely on them.
                </p>

                <h3>At least one thing thatn was surprising?</h3>

                <p>
                  We were surprised at a few things; how important great communication is and how quickly that communication improved.
                  Even if you have some very smart and skilled people working with you, even the best of skills can quickly fall apart with regularly communicating with others.
                  We were also surprised truly how much you can get done in a group when a deadline is on your doorstep alongside with its consequences,
                  although we can safely say this is not an ideal way of doing things and we would not want it to happen again
                </p>


                <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>

                  <p>
                    Going off on what was surprising, we learnt that communication and organisation is key to success and if that aspect isn’t nailed and perfected straight away then
                    it will make our lives immensely harder and lead to a worse result.
                    Many of us at first assumed that we could still get by communication was “fine” and not amazing, which we soon realised was very wrong.
                    Everyone needs to know where others are at, so we can plan accordingly and account for worse case scenarios.
                  </p>
